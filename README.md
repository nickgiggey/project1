Starting at github, clock on the green "Code" button roughly in the top right center area of the page and then copy the SSH link.

Go to your termial and once you've determined where you'd like to clone this program, enter "git clone <link>". "cd" into that folder. 

From there, either drag the index.html file onto a browser or press "Go Live".

When you first arrive, you will find the navigation bar at the top which will direct you to other sections of the website. Top right, you will find logo links that will redirect you to my social media websites. For example... to view my LinkedIn profile, click on the square icon with the two letters "i" and "n" inside.

Immediately you will find the carousel of my military deployment images. Simply click "next" or "prev" to scroll left and right through the pictures.

At the bottom of the website's home page, you'll see a couple of my side business' youtube videos directly linked which can be viewed in the browser.

At anytime, use the "to the top" button in the bottom left of the home page to immediately bring you back to the top of browser without having to scroll. 

My site is still very new and only the foundation has been laid so keep coming back to see updates on formating, visual appeal, addition content like updates in my hobbies... oh and check out my movie prop company's (Movie Relics) content in the links provided. Thank you very much for stopping by and feel free to email me with any recommendations! nickgiggey@comcast.net
